        Creates a new account for the user.

        Steps:
        - Prompts the user to log in to their connected cloud platforms using cloud_credentials via OAuth or similar methods.
        - Generates a random 256-bit string to serve as the salt for AES encryption.
        - Uploads the generated salt to all connected cloud platforms in a special file for future access.
        - Derives the private key by hashing the user-provided password with the salt using the Argon2id algorithm.
        - Uses the derived private key to encrypt user-specific information.
        - Ensures no sensitive data is stored locally; the key resides in-memory until the app is closed.

        - Derives the private key using the user-provided password and the retrieved salt via Argon2id.

        - Validates the decryption process by checking for the user's email address in the decrypted FileDescriptor.
